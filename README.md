Creating the Snake Game using C++.


- 🍂Fall 2023. For the term 2 of the usiveristy we decided to work on the Snake Game 🐍🐍.

- It was hard and complicated .

- We had to learn alot of things ourselves ,So we used alot of resources from YouTube chanels and of course ChatGpt😊😊.

- It took near a month to work on it but in the end we were satisfied about the result💪💪
